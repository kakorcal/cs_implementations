  Scientific Method:
  • Observe - some feature of the natural world
  • Hypothesize - a model that is consistent with the observations 
  • Predict - events using the hypothesis
  • Verify - the predictions by making further observations
  • Validate - by repeating until the hypothesis and observations agree

  Experimental Algorithms Power Law - T(N) = aN^b

  System independent effects - determines b in power law
    • algorithm
    • input data
  System dependent effects - determines a in power law
    • hardware: cpu, memory, cache
    • software: compiler, interpreter, garbage collector
    • system: operating system, network
